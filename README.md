## Features

- Transcribe voice messages using AWS Transcribe
- Summarize transcribed text using a custom API
- Allow users to tip for the service
- Secure handling of API keys and tokens
- Deployable as an AWS Lambda function

## Prerequisites

- Poetry for dependency management
- AWS account with Transcribe access
- Telegram Bot Token
- MarketRouter API Key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GroupLang-secretary-bot.git
   cd GroupLang-secretary-bot
   ```

2. Install Poetry if you haven't already:
   ```
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

3. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```
   poetry install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Set up environment variables:
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram Bot Token
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS Access Key ID
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS Secret Access Key
   - `MARKETROUTER_API_KEY`: Your MarketRouter API Key

2. Configure AWS credentials:
   - Either set up the AWS CLI or use environment variables as mentioned above

## Usage

1. Activate the Poetry virtual environment:
   ```
   poetry shell
   ```

2. Start the bot:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

3. In Telegram, start a conversation with the bot or add it to a group

4. Send a voice message to the bot

5. The bot will transcribe the audio, summarize the content, and send the result back

6. Users can tip using the inline button provided with the response

## Asynchronous Execution

The bot now supports asynchronous execution for improved performance. Key methods such as `transcribe_audio` in `services.py` and `send_message` in `utils/telegram_utils.py` have been updated to run asynchronously. This allows for concurrent processing of tasks, reducing overall waiting time and enhancing responsiveness.

To integrate these changes into your workflow, you can use `asyncio.gather` to manage multiple asynchronous tasks effectively. This setup is particularly beneficial when handling multiple audio transcriptions or sending multiple messages simultaneously.
